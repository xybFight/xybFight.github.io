Hi there! I am Yubin Xiao (肖钰彬). I completed my Ph.D. at [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/) (2021-2025), under the supervision of [Prof.You Zhou](https://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1367/19089.htm) and [Dr. Di Wang](https://www.diwang.org/home). Previously, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at Nanyang Technological University (2023.11-2024.11). 

My research interests include learning to optimize, aka neural combinatorial optimization (NCO), where we exploit Deep Learning (e.g., Reinforcement Learning and LLM techniques) to solve the classic Combinatorial Optimization Problems. I am also interested in Automatic algorithm design and Domain Adaptation/Generalization.
